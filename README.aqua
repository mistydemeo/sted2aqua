STed for Aqua
=============

  This is an experimental Cocoa/Mac OS X port of a MIDI sequencer "STed2".
The present version is barely functioinal; in particular, MIDI support is 
far from being useful. Any suggestions or patches are welcome.
  The files I have created (those in the "aqua" directories) are distributed 
with GPL2.
  For the original STed2 and its X Window version, see the "README" file.
